/!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
! There was a nasty bug in an external library with version 2.5.3 which caused !
! the database to become corrupted. We've added some recovery functions, but   !
! there could be data which is lost. You can either                            !
! A) live with that (in some cases the lost data could be gathered with a      !
!    scrape)                                                                   !
! B) take a backup file from the backup folder inside tmm (the last one before !
!    19.02.2014)                                                               !
! C) start over with a new database by deleting the old one (menu              !
!    Tools -> initialize database and rescan all your data sources.            !
!                                                                              !
! We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this bug!                  !
